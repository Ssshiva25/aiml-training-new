## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for learning the core concepts of AI and ML through hands-on projects. The programs are designed to give you experience with different types of machine learning techniques, from basic regression models to advanced neural networks and NLP tasks. 

The projects are part of an ongoing training program organized by **N.I.E.T College**, focused on equipping students with the skills needed to implement AI/ML solutions.
